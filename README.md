Upgrade your dApps with Huddle01 Video Conferencing SDK

Huddle01 is building a dRTC engine that enables users to create tools that fuel the future of real-time communication. Our platform aims to bring people closer via seamless video calling from anywhere in the world and help them express their thoughts and feelings without any privacy concerns.

Huddle01â€™s Video SDK is built upon the infrastructure that powers Huddle01 platform. So now you can create your dApp that can be as powerful as the Huddle01 dApp itself ðŸŽ¥

React is the most widely used framework by developers around the world to build efficient, scalable, and fast web applications. Weâ€™ve built our SDKs around it and have handled state management too!

The @huddle01/huddle01-client package comprises of 4 modules:

store Built-in state management built on top of zustand holding all states relevant to the conferencing (no need to manage your own state)

hooks Weâ€™ve extracted and encapsulated stateful logic and side effects from reused components, making it easier for you to reuse this logic across multiple components

utils Added standalone functions that are usually small and focused, and they are designed to be used as needed throughout and are helpers which are optional

schema This includes useful types and interfaces that will give you access to datatypes while implementing the @huddle01/huddle01-client package in Typescript
